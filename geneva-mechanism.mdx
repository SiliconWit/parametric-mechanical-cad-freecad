# Geneva Mechanism - Parametric CAD Design

## Engineering Context

### Why This Mechanism Matters

The Geneva mechanism (also called Maltese cross mechanism) provides precise, intermittent rotary motion - the driven wheel indexes (steps) to exact positions while the driver rotates continuously. It's elegant, reliable, and self-locking.

**Real-world applications:**
- Film projectors (advancing film frame-by-frame)
- Movie cameras (frame advance)
- Automatic machine tool changers
- Conveyor indexing systems
- Rotary tables in manufacturing
- Turret lathes (tool position indexing)
- Packaging machinery (precise positioning)

### Engineering Problem

**Given:** Continuous rotation input
**Required:** Intermittent, precise angular output with exact dwell periods
**Constraint:** Must lock in position during dwell (no creep or drift)

### Geneva Mechanism Principle

**Components:**

1. **Driver (Crank):** Rotates continuously, has a pin protruding from it
2. **Driven wheel (Geneva wheel):** Has radial slots, indexes when pin engages slot
3. **Locking arc:** Circular arc on driver that locks driven wheel during dwell

**Operation:**

1. **Dwell phase:** Driver's locking arc engages driven wheel's periphery, preventing rotation
2. **Index phase:** Driver pin enters driven wheel slot, rotating it to next position
3. **Dwell phase:** Locking arc re-engages, holding driven wheel stationary

### Key Parameters

- **Number of slots (n):** Typically 4, 5, 6, or 8
- **Index angle:** θ = 360° / n (angle driven wheel rotates per index)
- **Driver radius (R_d):** Radius to driving pin center
- **Driven wheel radius (R_g):** Distance from center to slot entry
- **Dwell ratio:** Fraction of driver rotation where driven wheel is stationary

**Geometric relationships:**

For an external Geneva mechanism with n slots:

```
R_g = R_d × tan(180° / n)
Slot center angle: 360° / n
Slot width: Designed to accommodate pin with clearance
```

### Common Configurations

- **4-slot:** 90° indexing, 1:4 gear ratio effect
- **6-slot:** 60° indexing, 1:6 ratio (we'll use this)
- **8-slot:** 45° indexing, 1:8 ratio

## What You'll Learn

By completing this lesson, you will:

- Design using polar geometry and patterns

- Apply circular patterns in sketches
- Design locking geometry for intermittent motion
- Use angular constraints precisely
- Generate indexed position technical drawings

**This lesson assumes no prior FreeCAD knowledge** - all concepts introduced from scratch.

## Part 1: FreeCAD Setup

### Starting Fresh

1. Launch FreeCAD
2. File → New (Ctrl+N)
3. Save as "GenevaMechanism.FCStd"

### Workbenches

- **Part Design** - Parts
- **Sketcher** - Polar geometry
- **Spreadsheet** - Parameters
- **Assembly** - Combining driver and driven wheel
- **TechDraw** - Documentation

---

## Part 2: Design Strategy

### Our Geneva Configuration

We'll design a **6-slot external Geneva mechanism**:

- 6 slots on driven wheel
- Index angle: 360° / 6 = 60°
- Driver rotates continuously
- Driven wheel dwells while driver completes 240° (4/6 of rotation)
- Driven wheel indexes 60° while driver completes 120° (2/6 of rotation)

### Parameter Strategy

Everything controlled by:
- Number of slots (n = 6)
- Driver center distance
- Pin diameter
- From these, all other dimensions calculated

### Creating Parameters

1. **Part Design workbench**

2. **Insert Spreadsheet**

3. **Enter parameters:**

```
A1: Parameter               B1: Value           C1: Unit    D1: Notes
A2: NumSlots                B2: 6               C2: count   D2: Number of slots
A3: DriverCenterDistance    B3: 80              C3: mm      D3: Between centers
A4: PinDiameter             B4: 10              C4: mm      D4: Driving pin
A5: PinRadius               B5: =B4/2           C5: mm

A8: DriverRadius            B8: =B3/2           C8: mm      D8: To pin center (simplified)
A9: DrivenRadius            B9: =B8*TAN(180/B2) C9: mm      D9: Geneva radius (calculated)
A10: WheelThickness         B10: 15             C10: mm
A11: ShaftDiameter          B11: 20             C11: mm
A12: ShaftRadius            B12: =B11/2         C12: mm
A13: SlotWidth              B13: =B5*2.5        C13: mm     D13: Pin diameter × 1.25 (clearance)
```

**Note:** Cell B9 uses TAN function to calculate driven wheel radius geometrically.

**Important:** In FreeCAD spreadsheet, angle functions use degrees if you specify the angle in degrees, but verify. Use `RADIANS()` if needed.

4. **Create aliases** for all B column values

5. **Close spreadsheet**

## Part 4: Creating the Driver (Crank)

### Driver Design Intent

Disk with:
- Central shaft hole
- Driving pin at radius R_d
- Locking arc on periphery

### Step-by-Step: Driver

#### 1. Create Body

- Part Design workbench
- Create Body → "Driver"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Driver Disk

**Main circle:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: We'll use a value slightly larger than DriverRadius for the body
- Try: 50mm

**Shaft hole:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ShaftRadius`

**Driving pin position:**

- Circle (for pin hole or pin body)
- Center position: Distance from origin = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.DriverRadius`
- Place on horizontal axis (0° angle)
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

**Constrain pin position:**

- Horizontal distance from origin to pin center = DriverRadius
- Vertical coordinate = 0

**Locking arc (as reference):**

We'll add the locking arc in a separate step or as part of the periphery shape.

For simplicity, the driver disk itself acts as the locking element.

#### 4. Close and Pad

- Close sketch
- Pad: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.WheelThickness`

#### 5. Add Driving Pin (Optional separate part)

**Alternative:** Create pin as separate feature:

- New sketch on top face of driver
- Circle at pin position
- Pad upward (protrudes from driver face)

---

## Part 5: Creating the Driven Wheel (Geneva Wheel)

### Geneva Wheel Design Intent

Disk with:
- n radial slots (6 for our design)
- Central shaft hole
- Locking periphery (circular with cutouts at slots)

### Step-by-Step: Geneva Wheel

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body → "GenevaWheel"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Base Circle

**Main wheel circle:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.DrivenRadius` (calculated as R_d × tan(180/n))

**Shaft hole:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ShaftRadius`

#### 4. Draw One Slot

**Slot as radial rectangle:**

- Rectangle
- Oriented radially from wheel center
- Width (perpendicular to radius): ƒx → `Spreadsheet.SlotWidth`
- Length (radial): Extends from near center to periphery
- Position at 0° (horizontal right)

**Constrain slot:**

- Symmetric about horizontal axis (or positioned at exact angle)
- Distance from center to slot start: appropriate clearance
- Distance from center to slot end: near or at wheel edge

**Slot entry shape (optional refinement):**

For smooth pin entry, the slot entry can be rounded or shaped. For simplicity, rectangular slot is acceptable.

#### 5. Pattern the Slot

**Polar pattern:**

- Select the slot rectangle
- Use **Polar Pattern** constraint or tool
- Center: Origin
- Number of instances: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.NumSlots` (6)
- Angular spacing: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.SlotAngle` (60°)

This creates 6 equally spaced slots!

#### 6. Create Locking Periphery

The wheel periphery between slots should be circular (for locking arc engagement), with cutouts only at slot openings.

**Method:**
- The base circle provides the locking surface
- Slots cut into it

The sketch should now show:
- Central shaft hole
- 6 radial slots evenly spaced
- Circular periphery between slots

#### 7. Close and Pad

- Close sketch
- Pad: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.WheelThickness`

The Geneva wheel is complete!

## Part 6: Creating the Base Frame

### Frame Design Intent

Fixed mounting with:
- Shaft bearings for both driver and Geneva wheel
- Proper center distance

### Step-by-Step: Frame

#### 1. Create Body

- Body: "Frame"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Base Plate

- Rectangle
- Width: 200mm
- Height: 120mm
- Centered

#### 4. Add Shaft Holes

**Driver shaft hole:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ShaftRadius + clearance

**Geneva wheel shaft hole:**

- Circle at distance = DriverCenterDistance
- Position on horizontal axis (right of origin)
- Radius: ShaftRadius + clearance

**Constrain:**

- Horizontal distance between centers = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.DriverCenterDistance`

#### 5. Mounting Holes

Add 4 corner bolt holes for mounting frame.

#### 6. Close and Pad

- Pad: 20mm

---

## Part 7: Assembly

<InArticleAd />


### Assembly Strategy

- Fix frame
- Driver rotates about left shaft
- Geneva wheel rotates about right shaft
- Driver pin engages Geneva wheel slots

### Step-by-Step: Assembly

#### 1. Assembly Workbench

#### 2. Add Parts

- Frame
- Driver
- GenevaWheel

#### 3. Apply Constraints

**Fix frame:**

- Frame: Fixed

**Driver rotation:**

- Driver shaft hole → Frame driver shaft hole: Axial align
- Allows driver to rotate about its axis

**Geneva wheel rotation:**

- Geneva wheel shaft hole → Frame Geneva shaft hole: Axial align
- Allows Geneva wheel to rotate about its axis

**Initial positioning:**

Position driver such that pin is entering one of the Geneva wheel slots.

### Test Motion

Manually rotate driver:

1. **Dwell:** Driver rotates, Geneva wheel locked (pin not in slot)
2. **Index:** Driver pin enters slot, rotates Geneva wheel 60°
3. **Dwell:** Pin exits, Geneva wheel locked again

Repeat through 6 positions.

## Part 8: Technical Drawing

### Creating Geneva Mechanism Drawing

#### 1. TechDraw Workbench

#### 2. Create Page

- A3_Landscape

#### 3. Add Top View

- Shows both wheels in plan view
- Clearly visible: pin, slots, center distance

#### 4. Add Multiple Position Views

Create 3 views showing different phases:

- **View 1:** Driver at 0° (pin entering slot 1)
- **View 2:** Driver at 60° (mid-index, Geneva rotating)
- **View 3:** Driver at 120° (pin exited, dwell begins)

#### 5. Dimension Key Features

- Center distance
- Slot angle (60°)
- Pin diameter
- Number of slots (note: 6)

#### 6. Add Timing Diagram

Sketch a diagram showing:
- X-axis: Driver rotation (0° to 360°)
- Y-axis: Geneva wheel position (discrete steps at 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°)
- Show dwell periods (horizontal lines) and index periods (vertical jumps)

#### 7. Export

- PDF

## Part 9: Testing Parametric Control

### Change Number of Slots

1. Open Spreadsheet
2. Change NumSlots from 6 to 4
3. Recompute

All geometry updates:
- Slots now 90° apart
- Index angle = 90°
- Driven radius recalculated
- 4 slots appear on Geneva wheel

**Test different values:**
- NumSlots = 8 (45° indexing)
- NumSlots = 5 (72° indexing)

### Change Center Distance

- Increase DriverCenterDistance to 100mm
- Larger mechanism
- All ratios maintain

## Design Verification

<InArticleAd />


1. **Do all slots align radially from center?**
2. **Are slots evenly spaced (60° apart for 6-slot)?**
3. **Does driving pin fit into slots with clearance?**
4. **When NumSlots changes, does geometry update correctly?**
5. **Is the center distance appropriate for smooth pin engagement?**

---

## Mathematical Background

### Geneva Wheel Radius Calculation

For an external Geneva mechanism:

```
R_g = R_d × tan(180° / n)

Where:
R_g = Geneva wheel radius (center to slot entry)
R_d = Driver radius (center to pin)
n = Number of slots
```

**For n = 6:**

```
R_g = R_d × tan(30°)
R_g = R_d × 0.577
```

If R_d = 40mm, then R_g ≈ 23mm.

### Dwell vs. Index Time

**Dwell angle:** 360° × (n - 2) / n

**Index angle:** 360° / n

**For 6-slot Geneva:**
- Dwell: 360° × 4/6 = 240° of driver rotation
- Index: 360° × 1/6 = 60° of driver rotation

---

## Challenges for Further Practice

1. **Design an internal Geneva mechanism** (pin inside driven wheel)
2. **Add a safety guard** covering moving parts
3. **Create a double-Geneva** (two Geneva wheels on same driver)
4. **Design a spherical Geneva** (3D version for spatial indexing)
5. **Add position sensors** (mounting for optical sensors to detect index positions)
6. **Model wear analysis** (contact stress at pin/slot interface)

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Slots not evenly spaced"

- **Cause:** Polar pattern not set to correct angle or count
- **Solution:** Verify SlotAngle = 360 / NumSlots
- **Fix:** Check pattern constraints reference spreadsheet parameters

### "Pin doesn't fit in slot"

- **Cause:** Slot width too narrow
- **Solution:** SlotWidth should be 1.2-1.5 × PinDiameter
- **Fix:** Adjust SlotWidth parameter

### "Geneva wheel radius seems wrong"

- **Cause:** Incorrect TAN formula or units
- **Solution:** Verify formula: =B8*TAN(180°/B2)
- **Fix:** Check that TAN function uses degrees (or convert with RADIANS())

### "Mechanism binds during motion"

- **Cause:** Center distance incorrect or slot angle wrong
- **Solution:** Recalculate center distance using correct geometry
- **Fix:** Verify all geometric relationships
