# Four-Bar Linkage Mechanism - Parametric CAD Design

## Engineering Context

### Why This Mechanism Matters

The four-bar linkage is one of the simplest yet most versatile planar mechanisms. It forms the foundation of countless mechanical systems including hinges, folding mechanisms, and complex motion control systems.

**Real-world applications:**
- Vehicle suspension systems
- Excavator arms and construction equipment
- Door hinges and folding mechanisms
- Windshield wiper linkages
- Robotic arm joints
- Adjustable desk and chair mechanisms

### Engineering Problem

**Given:** Four rigid links connected by revolute joints
**Required:** Controlled motion transformation with specific path characteristics
**Constraint:** One link must be fixed (ground link)

### Mechanism Components

A four-bar linkage consists of:

1. **Ground Link (Link 1)** - Fixed base
2. **Input Link/Crank (Link 2)** - Driven link, typically rotates fully
3. **Coupler (Link 3)** - Connects input and output links
4. **Output Link/Follower (Link 4)** - Produces desired motion

### Key Parameters and Grashof's Theorem

The behavior depends critically on the link length relationships. Grashof's Theorem states:

**S + L ≤ P + Q**

Where:
- S = shortest link length
- L = longest link length
- P, Q = intermediate link lengths

**If the inequality holds:**
- At least one link can rotate 360°
- The mechanism is called "Grashof linkage"

**Which link is ground determines behavior:**
- **Grashof Crank-Rocker:** Crank rotates 360°, follower oscillates
- **Grashof Double-Crank:** Both crank and follower rotate 360°
- **Grashof Double-Rocker:** Both crank and follower oscillate

**If the inequality doesn't hold:**
- **Non-Grashof linkage:** No link can rotate fully, all oscillate

### Design Ratios

For this lesson, we'll use:
- Link 1 (ground) = 100 mm
- Link 2 (crank) = 40 mm
- Link 3 (coupler) = 80 mm
- Link 4 (follower) = 70 mm

Check: S=40, L=100, P=70, Q=80
S + L = 140, P + Q = 150
Since 140 ≤ 150, this is a Grashof linkage (crank-rocker type).

- **Pan:** Shift + Middle mouse button + drag
- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel
- **Fit all:** V, then F

---

## Part 2: Design Strategy

### Master Sketch Approach

Unlike the slider crank where each part had its own sketch, we'll use a **master sketch** approach:

1. Create one sketch defining all link centerlines and joint positions
2. Use this sketch as reference for all parts
3. Change the master sketch, and all parts update automatically

This is powerful for mechanisms where relationships between parts matter more than individual part dimensions.

### Our Parameter Table

We'll control the entire mechanism with four lengths:

- **Link1** = 100 mm (ground)
- **Link2** = 40 mm (crank)
- **Link3** = 80 mm (coupler)
- **Link4** = 70 mm (follower)

---

## Part 4: Creating the Master Sketch

### What is a Master Sketch?

A master sketch defines the kinematic layout - where joints are located and how links connect. Parts reference this sketch geometry.

### Step-by-Step: Master Sketch

#### 1. Create the Sketch

- In Part Design workbench
- Create new sketch on XY_Plane
- This sketch won't belong to a body - it's standalone

#### 2. Draw the Ground Link (Link 1)

**Draw a horizontal line:**

- Line tool (L)
- Click at origin (0, 0)
- Draw horizontally to the right
- Click to place endpoint
- Press Escape

**Make it horizontal:**

- Select the line
- Press "H" for horizontal constraint

**Fix the start point:**

- Coincident constraint
- Click left endpoint
- Click origin
- This fixes one point at (0,0)

**Dimension the link:**

- Distance constraint
- Click both endpoints
- Click ƒx button
- Formula: `Spreadsheet.Link1`
- Enter

Label this mentally as "ground link" with joints A (left) and B (right).

#### 3. Draw the Crank (Link 2)

**Draw a line from point A:**

- Line tool
- Start at the left endpoint of Link 1 (point A)
- Draw at an angle upward-right
- Click to place endpoint
- Escape

**Constrain the link:**

- Coincident constraint
- Click start of new line
- Click left endpoint of Link 1 (point A)

- Distance constraint (length)
- Click both endpoints of the new line
- ƒx → `Spreadsheet.Link2`
- Enter

This is the crank, connecting points A and C.

#### 4. Draw the Follower (Link 4)

**Draw a line from point B:**

- Line tool
- Start at right endpoint of Link 1 (point B)
- Draw upward at an angle
- Click to place endpoint
- Escape

**Constrain:**

- Coincident at point B
- Distance = `Spreadsheet.Link4`

This is the follower, connecting points B and D.

#### 5. Draw the Coupler (Link 3)

**Draw a line connecting the free ends:**

- Line tool
- Start at free end of Link 2 (point C)
- End at free end of Link 4 (point D)
- Escape

**Constrain:**

- Coincident at point C
- Coincident at point D
- Distance = `Spreadsheet.Link3`

Now you have a closed four-bar linkage!

#### 6. Add Construction Geometry

We want this sketch to be reference only, not solid geometry:

- Select all four lines (Ctrl+A or box select)
- Press G for "Construction geometry toggle"
- Lines turn blue/dashed

**Why construction geometry?**
- It's reference only, not solid
- Parts will reference these lines but won't inherit them as features

#### 7. Check Constraints

The sketch should be fully constrained. If not:

- Link 1 needs: horizontal, one end at origin, length
- Link 2 needs: coincident at A, length, angle (can be free for now)
- Link 3 needs: coincident at C and D, length
- Link 4 needs: coincident at B, length

You may add an angle dimension to Link 2 to fully constrain it (say, 30° from horizontal).

#### 8. Close the Sketch

The master sketch is now complete!

---

## Part 5: Creating Link 1 (Ground Link)

### Design Intent

Link 1 is a rectangular plate with circular holes at each end for pivot pins.

### Step-by-Step: Link 1

#### 1. Create a Body

- Create Body
- Rename: "Link1_Ground"

#### 2. Create a Sketch

- Select Link1_Ground body
- Create sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw the Link Plate

**Reference the master sketch:**

The joints are already defined. We'll build the link shape around them.

**Draw circles at joints A and B:**

- Circle tool
- Draw circle centered at origin (point A in master sketch)
- Escape

- Circle tool
- Draw circle at point (100, 0) - point B
- Escape

**Constrain the circles:**

- Coincident: Center of first circle → origin
- Coincident: Center of second circle → use coordinate (100,0) or reference the master sketch point

To reference master sketch point:
- External geometry tool (E)
- Click the master sketch in the tree
- Select the endpoint you want to reference
- It appears as purple geometry in your sketch

**Dimension the holes:**

- Radius constraint on each circle
- ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

**Draw the connecting body:**

- Rectangle tool
- Draw rectangle connecting the two circles
- Use Symmetric constraint to center it on the line between holes

**Dimension:**

- Width (perpendicular to link axis) = `Spreadsheet.LinkWidth`

**Finalize:**

- Sketch should be fully constrained
- Close sketch

#### 4. Pad the Link

- Select the sketch
- Pad tool
- Length: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.LinkThickness`
- OK

Link 1 complete!

---

## Part 6: Creating Link 2 (Crank)

### Design Intent

Similar rectangular link with holes at ends, but follows Link 2 geometry from master sketch.

### Step-by-Step: Link 2

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body → "Link2_Crank"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Reference Master Sketch Geometry

- External geometry tool (E)
- Select master sketch from tree
- Click Link 2 endpoints (point A and point C)
- They appear as purple reference points

#### 4. Draw the Link

- Circle at point A, radius = `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`
- Circle at point C, radius = `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`
- Rectangle connecting them
- Symmetric constraint about Link 2 centerline
- Width = `Spreadsheet.LinkWidth`

#### 5. Pad

- Thickness = `Spreadsheet.LinkThickness`

---

## Part 7: Creating Link 3 (Coupler)

<InArticleAd />


Repeat the same process:

1. Body: "Link3_Coupler"
2. Sketch on XY_Plane
3. Reference points C and D from master sketch
4. Circles + rectangle + symmetric
5. Pad with thickness parameter

---

## Part 8: Creating Link 4 (Follower)

Repeat again:

1. Body: "Link4_Follower"
2. Sketch on XY_Plane
3. Reference points B and D from master sketch
4. Circles + rectangle + symmetric
5. Pad

---

## Part 9: Assembly

### Assembly Strategy

- Fix Link 1 (ground)
- Allow Link 2, 3, 4 to rotate about their pin joints
- The mechanism should move smoothly

### Step-by-Step Assembly

#### 1. Switch to Assembly Workbench

#### 2. Create Assembly

- Create new assembly

#### 3. Add Parts

- Add Link1_Ground
- Add Link2_Crank
- Add Link3_Coupler
- Add Link4_Follower

#### 4. Apply Constraints

**Fix Link 1:**

- Select Link1_Ground
- Fixed constraint

**Joint at A (Link 1 - Link 2):**

- Select hole axis from Link 1 at point A
- Select hole axis from Link 2 at point A
- Axial align constraint
- This allows rotation

**Joint at B (Link 1 - Link 4):**

- Link 1 hole at B
- Link 4 hole at B
- Axial align

**Joint at C (Link 2 - Link 3):**

- Link 2 hole at C
- Link 3 hole at C
- Axial align

**Joint at D (Link 3 - Link 4):**

- Link 3 hole at D
- Link 4 hole at D
- Axial align

### Test Motion

## Part 11: Testing Parametric Control

<InArticleAd />


### Experiment with Link Lengths

1. Open Spreadsheet
2. Change Link2 to 50mm (longer crank)
3. Recompute (Ctrl+R)
4. Watch the mechanism update!

### Test Grashof's Theorem

Try these link lengths:

**Configuration 1: Crank-Rocker (current)**
- Link1=100, Link2=40, Link3=80, Link4=70
- Link2 should rotate fully

**Configuration 2: Change to Double-Rocker**
- Link1=40, Link2=100, Link3=80, Link4=70
- Now Link1 is shortest, making it double-rocker

**Configuration 3: Non-Grashof**
- Link1=100, Link2=20, Link3=80, Link4=70
- S+L = 120, P+Q = 150
- No link can rotate fully!

---

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you have:

- ✅ Created a master sketch for kinematic layout
- ✅ Used construction geometry as reference
- ✅ Referenced external geometry in multiple sketches
- ✅ Built four interacting parametric parts
- ✅ Assembled a pin-jointed mechanism
- ✅ Applied Grashof's Theorem in practice
- ✅ Tested different linkage configurations

---

## Design Verification

1. **Does your mechanism assemble without interference?**
2. **Can Link 2 rotate smoothly through 360°?**
3. **When you change link lengths, does the mechanism update correctly?**
4. **Can you identify whether your configuration is Grashof or non-Grashof?**

---

## Challenges for Further Practice

1. **Add a tracer point** on Link 3 (coupler point) - plot its path
2. **Design a pin** to connect the joints (separate part)
3. **Create a motion study** showing the linkage through one complete cycle
4. **Try to design a straight-line mechanism** (special four-bar that traces approximate straight line)
5. **Add labels** to your assembly showing which link is which

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Parts don't align in assembly"

- Ensure you referenced the same master sketch points in all part sketches
- Check that pin hole radii are identical where links connect

### "Mechanism is locked/won't move"

- Check that only Link 1 has Fixed constraint
- All other links should have only Axial align constraints at pins
- Too many constraints will over-constrain the system

### "Master sketch is under-constrained"

- Each link needs length dimension
- Need one angle dimension to set initial configuration
- One point must be fixed (origin)

---

## Next Steps

In the next lesson on **Scissor Lift Mechanism**, we'll explore:

- Repeating linkage geometry
- Symmetric mechanism design
- Motion amplification
- Load paths in pin-jointed structures
- Managing multiple instances of the same part
