# Pantograph Mechanism - Parametric CAD Design

## Engineering Context

### Why This Mechanism Matters

A pantograph is a mechanical linkage that scales motion - it can enlarge, reduce, or exactly copy a path traced by one point as output at another point. This elegant mechanism based on similar triangles has been used for centuries.

**Real-world applications:**
- Engraving and routing machines (copying patterns)
- Drafting tools (enlarging or reducing drawings)
- Train pantographs (power collection, different use but same name)
- Motion scaling in manufacturing
- Educational math demonstrators (similar triangles)
- Robotic manipulators (coordinated motion)

### Engineering Problem

**Given:** A path traced by an input stylus or pointer
**Required:** Reproduce that path at a different scale
**Constraint:** Maintain geometric similarity and smooth motion

### Pantograph Principle

A pantograph consists of four links forming a parallelogram-like structure with specific length ratios. Key principle:

**Similar Triangles:**

If links are arranged such that:
- One pivot is fixed (O)
- Input point (I) traces a path
- Output point (P) is positioned on an extension of link OI

Then: **OP / OI = constant ratio (k)**

This ratio k is the **scaling factor**:
- k > 1: Enlargement (output motion larger than input)
- k = 1: Exact copy (1:1 pantograph)
- k < 1: Reduction (output smaller than input)

### Geometric Requirements

For a pantograph with scaling ratio k:

```
Link arrangement:
- OA and OB are two links from fixed pivot O
- A and B are moving pivots
- AB is a connecting link
- I (input) is on link OA
- P (output) is on link OB extended

Length relationships:
OA / OI = OB / OP = AB / IP = k
```

The parallelogram OAIB ensures that triangles OIA and OPB remain similar as the mechanism moves.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this lesson, you will:

- Design mechanisms based on ratio relationships
- Use expressions to link multiple dimensions
- Create similar triangle geometry
- Implement scaling factor control
- Design for smooth planar motion
- Reuse parametric parts across assemblies
- Document ratio-based mechanisms

**This lesson assumes no prior FreeCAD knowledge** - all concepts explained from scratch.

---

## Part 1: FreeCAD Setup

### Starting Fresh

1. Launch FreeCAD
2. File → New (Ctrl+N)
3. Save as "Pantograph.FCStd"

### Workbenches

- **Part Design** - Individual parts
- **Sketcher** - Constrained sketches
- **Spreadsheet** - Parameters and ratios
- **Assembly** - Combining links
- **TechDraw** - Documentation

---

## Part 2: Design Strategy

### Our Pantograph Configuration

We'll build a classic 4-bar pantograph with:
- Fixed pivot O at origin
- Scaling ratio k = 2:1 (output is 2× input)
- Input stylus at point I
- Output tracer at point P

### Link Naming

- **Link 1:** Fixed base (ground)
- **Link OA:** From fixed pivot O to moving pivot A
- **Link OB:** From fixed pivot O to moving pivot B
- **Link AB:** Connecting moving pivots A and B
- **Arm OI:** From O through A to input point I
- **Arm OP:** From O through B to output point P

### Parameter Strategy

Control everything with:
- Base link length (OA and OB lengths)
- Scaling ratio k
- All other dimensions calculated from these

---

## Part 3: Parameter Spreadsheet

### Creating the Spreadsheet

1. **Part Design workbench**

2. **Insert Spreadsheet**

3. **Enter parameters:**

```
A1: Parameter        B1: Value         C1: Unit    D1: Formula/Note
A2: ScalingRatio     B2: 2             C2: ratio   D2: k (output/input)
A3: BaseLength       B3: 100           C3: mm      D3: Length OA = OB
A4: InputLength      B4: =B3*B2        C4: mm      D4: OI = BaseLength × k
A5: OutputLength     B5: =B3*B2*B2     C5: mm      D5: OP = BaseLength × k²
A6: CrossLink        B6: =B3*B2        C6: mm      D6: AB = IP = InputLength
A7: LinkWidth        B7: 20            C7: mm
A8: LinkThickness    B8: 6             C8: mm
A9: PinDiameter      B9: 6             C9: mm
A10: PinRadius       B10: =B9/2        C10: mm
```

**Note the expressions in column B:**
- InputLength = BaseLength × ScalingRatio
- OutputLength = BaseLength × ScalingRatio²
- CrossLink = InputLength

These ensure the similar triangle relationships are maintained!

4. **Create aliases:**
   - B2: `ScalingRatio`
   - B3: `BaseLength`
   - B4: `InputLength`
   - B5: `OutputLength`
   - B6: `CrossLink`
   - B7: `LinkWidth`
   - B8: `LinkThickness`
   - B10: `PinRadius`

5. **Close spreadsheet**

### Why Master Sketch for Pantograph?

The pantograph's geometric relationships are critical. A master sketch ensures all link lengths maintain proper ratios.

### Step-by-Step: Master Sketch

#### 1. Create Standalone Sketch

- Part Design workbench
- Create sketch on XY_Plane
- This won't belong to a body

#### 2. Draw Fixed Pivot O

- Point at origin (0, 0)
- This is our fixed pivot

#### 3. Draw Link OA

- Line tool
- Start at origin
- Draw at 45° upward-right
- Length constraint: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseLength`
- Angle constraint: 45° from horizontal

Label endpoint as "A"

#### 4. Draw Link OB

- Line tool
- Start at origin
- Draw horizontally right
- Length constraint: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseLength`
- Horizontal constraint

Label endpoint as "B"

#### 5. Draw Cross Link AB

- Line tool
- Connect points A and B
- Length constraint: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.CrossLink`

This forms triangle OAB.

#### 6. Extend OA to Input Point I

- Line tool
- Continue from A along the same angle as OA
- Or: Draw line from O through A
- Total length from O to I: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.InputLength`

Use Construction line for the full length OI.

#### 7. Extend OB to Output Point P

- Line tool
- Continue from B along same direction as OB
- Total length from O to P: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.OutputLength`

Construction line for full length OP.

#### 8. Mark Key Points

Add small circles at O, A, B, I, P (radius 2mm, just for visualization).

#### 9. Make All Construction Geometry

- Select all lines
- Press G to toggle construction mode
- Lines turn blue/dashed

#### 10. Check Constraints

Should be fully constrained:
- O is at origin
- OA length and angle defined
- OB length and horizontal
- AB length defined
- OI length defined
- OP length defined

#### 11. Close Sketch

Master sketch complete!

- Create Body → "Link_OA"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Reference Master Sketch

- External Geometry tool (E)
- Select master sketch from tree
- Click points O and A
- They appear as purple reference points

#### 4. Draw Link

#### 5. Close and Pad

- Pad: LinkThickness

---

## Part 6: Creating Link OB

Same process as Link OA:

## Part 11: Assembly

### Assembly Strategy

- Fix base
- Both Link_OA and Link_OB pivot at O
- InputArm and OutputArm also pivot at O (coaxial with links)

#### 2. Add Parts

- Add Base
- Add Link_OA
- Add Link_OB
- Add Link_AB
- Add InputArm
- Add OutputArm

#### 3. Apply Constraints

**Fix base:**

- Base: Fixed constraint

**Pivot at O:**

All four links (OA, OB, InputArm, OutputArm) pivot at O:

- Link_OA hole at O → Base hole at O: Axial align
- Link_OB hole at O → Base hole at O: Axial align
- InputArm hole at O → Base hole at O: Axial align
- OutputArm hole at O → Base hole at O: Axial align

**Joint at A:**

- Link_OA hole at A → Link_AB hole at A: Axial align
- InputArm hole at A → Link_OA hole at A: Axial align

**Joint at B:**

- Link_OB hole at B → Link_AB hole at B: Axial align
- OutputArm hole at B → Link_OB hole at B: Axial align

### Test Motion

Drag the input arm (point I) - the output point P should trace a path that is 2× larger!

---

## Part 12: Verifying the Scaling Ratio

### Manual Test

1. **Mark a starting position:**
   - Note position of I and P

2. **Move input point I by 10mm horizontally**
   - Measure new position

3. **Check output point P**
   - Should have moved 20mm horizontally (2× input)

### Parametric Test

1. Open Spreadsheet
2. Change ScalingRatio from 2 to 3
3. Recompute
4. All link lengths update automatically!
5. Test motion again - now output should be 3× input

---

## Part 13: Technical Drawing

### Creating Pantograph Drawing

#### 1. TechDraw Workbench

#### 2. Create Page

- A3_Landscape

#### 3. Add Assembly View

- Front view showing full mechanism

#### 4. Add Dimensional Analysis

Link Lengths:
OA = OB = 100 mm
OI = 200 mm (k × OA)
OP = 400 mm (k² × OA)
AB = 200 mm (k × OA)
```

#### 5. Add Motion Diagram

- Position 1: Input at I₁, output at P₁
- Position 2: Input at I₂, output at P₂
- Dimension: ΔI = 10mm, ΔP = 20mm

#### 6. Export

## Part 14: Testing Parametric Control

<InArticleAd />


### Experiment 1: Change Scaling Ratio

**k = 1 (1:1 copy):**
```
ScalingRatio = 1
All lengths become equal to BaseLength
```

**k = 3 (3× enlargement):**
```
ScalingRatio = 3
InputLength = 300mm
OutputLength = 900mm
```

### Experiment 2: Change Base Size

- BaseLength from 100 to 150
- Entire mechanism scales up proportionally
- Scaling ratio remains constant

---

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you have:

- ✅ Designed a ratio-driven mechanism
- ✅ Used expressions to link multiple dimensions
- ✅ Created similar triangle geometry
- ✅ Implemented parametric scaling control
- ✅ Designed for smooth planar motion
- ✅ Reused parametric parts across assembly
- ✅ Documented ratio-based mechanisms
- ✅ Verified motion scaling through testing

---

## Design Verification

1. **Does the output point move smoothly as input moves?**
2. **Is the scaling ratio correct? (Test with measurements)**
3. **When you change ScalingRatio parameter, do all links update correctly?**
4. **Does the mechanism maintain similar triangle geometry throughout motion?**
5. **Are there any binding points or dead spots?**

---

## Mathematical Verification

### Calculating Output Position

For a pantograph with scaling ratio k:

```
If input point I is at (x, y) relative to O,
Then output point P is at (k×x, k×y) relative to O
```

**Example:**
- Input moves to I = (50, 50)
- With k = 2
- Output should be at P = (100, 100)

Test this in your assembly!

---

## Challenges for Further Practice

1. **Design a reduction pantograph** (k = 0.5, output smaller than input)
2. **Add a stylus holder** at input point (removable, adjustable)
3. **Add a pen/pencil holder** at output point
4. **Create a locking mechanism** to fix position
5. **Design a trammel attachment** (for drawing ellipses)
6. **Build a 3D pantograph** (scales motion in XY plane vertically)

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Output doesn't scale correctly"

- **Cause:** Incorrect link length ratios
- **Solution:** Verify expressions in spreadsheet
- **Fix:** InputLength must = BaseLength × k
- **Fix:** OutputLength must = BaseLength × k²

### "Mechanism binds or locks up"

- **Cause:** Links interfering, or over-constrained assembly
- **Solution:** Check clearances, ensure only Base is Fixed
- **Fix:** May need to offset arms in Z-direction

### "Scaling ratio parameter doesn't update links"

- **Cause:** Dimensions not using formulas
- **Solution:** Check that InputLength cell has `=B3*B2` not a hardcoded value
- **Fix:** Recreate spreadsheet formulas

### "Parts misalign in assembly"

- **Cause:** Not referencing master sketch consistently
- **Solution:** All part sketches must use External Geometry from same master sketch
- **Fix:** Rebuild parts referencing master sketch points
