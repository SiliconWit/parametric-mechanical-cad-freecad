# Scotch Yoke Mechanism - Parametric CAD Design

## Engineering Context

### Why This Mechanism Matters

The Scotch yoke mechanism converts rotary motion to linear motion with a perfect sinusoidal profile. Unlike the slider-crank which produces approximate sinusoidal motion, the Scotch yoke creates mathematically pure sinusoidal displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

**Real-world applications:**
- Control valve actuators (precise modulation)
- Solenoid replacement in low-speed applications
- Testing machines (sinusoidal loading)
- Reciprocating pumps (oil-free compressors)
- Wave motion simulators
- Educational demonstrations of simple harmonic motion

### Engineering Problem

**Given:** Constant rotational motion input
**Required:** Linear reciprocating output with pure sinusoidal characteristics
**Constraint:** Compact design, low mechanical complexity

### Scotch Yoke Principle

**Mechanism:**

1. **Rotating crank:** Circular disk with eccentric pin
2. **Yoke (slider):** Block with horizontal slot
3. **Pin-in-slot connection:** Pin slides within yoke slot as crank rotates
4. **Guide:** Constrains yoke to linear motion only

**Motion relationship:**

```
Displacement: x(t) = r × sin(ωt)
Velocity: v(t) = r × ω × cos(ωt)
Acceleration: a(t) = -r × ω² × sin(ωt)

Where:
r = crank radius (eccentricity)
ω = angular velocity
t = time
```

**Key characteristic:** The yoke displacement is exactly proportional to sin(θ), where θ is crank angle.

### Comparison with Slider-Crank

| Feature | Scotch Yoke | Slider-Crank |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Motion profile | Pure sinusoidal | Approximate sinusoidal |
| Complexity | Simpler (no connecting rod) | More complex |
| Stroke | Stroke = 2r (compact) | Stroke = 2r (requires longer rod) |
| Side forces | Minimal (guides handle them) | Significant (on cylinder walls) |
| Wear | Sliding contact (higher) | Pivoting contacts (lower) |

### Key Parameters

- **Crank radius (r):** Determines stroke (Stroke = 2r)
- **Slot length:** Must accommodate full pin travel
- **Slot width:** Pin diameter + clearance
- **Guide length:** Ensures yoke stays aligned throughout stroke

## Part 4: Creating the Crank

### Crank Design Intent

Rotating disk with:
- Central shaft hole
- Eccentric pin at radius r from center

### Step-by-Step: Crank

#### 1. Create Body

- Part Design workbench
- Create Body → "Crank"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Crank Disk

**Main disk:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.CrankDiskRadius`

**Shaft hole:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ShaftRadius`

**Eccentric pin:**

- Circle offset from origin
- Position: Horizontal, distance = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.CrankRadius`
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

**Constrain pin position:**

- Horizontal constraint: Pin center and origin on same horizontal line
- Distance from origin to pin center: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.CrankRadius`

#### 4. Close and Pad

- Close sketch
- Pad: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.CrankThickness`

#### 5. Add Protruding Pin (Optional)

**Create pin as separate feature:**

- New sketch on crank face
- Circle at pin position
- Pad: 15mm (protrudes from crank to engage yoke slot)

Or model pin as separate part.

---

## Part 5: Creating the Yoke

### Yoke Design Intent

Sliding block with:
- Horizontal slot for crank pin
- Rectangular body
- Provisions for guide engagement

### Step-by-Step: Yoke

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body → "Yoke"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Yoke Body

**Outer rectangle:**

- Rectangle centered at origin
- Width (horizontal): ƒx → `Spreadsheet.YokeWidth`
- Height (vertical): ƒx → `Spreadsheet.YokeHeight`
- Use Symmetric constraints to center about origin

#### 4. Draw Horizontal Slot

**Slot as rectangle:**

- Rectangle (horizontal orientation)
- Width: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.SlotLength`
- Height: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.SlotWidth`
- Centered horizontally and vertically on yoke

**Constrain slot:**

- Symmetric about both X and Y axes
- This places slot through center of yoke

**Round slot ends (optional):**

For smooth pin travel, round the slot ends:

- Add circles (radius = SlotWidth/2) at each slot end
- Tangent to slot sides

#### 5. Close and Pad

- Close sketch
- Pad: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.YokeThickness`

The yoke now has a horizontal slot through it!

---

## Part 6: Creating the Guide Rails

### Guide Design Intent

Two parallel rails that constrain yoke to linear motion, preventing rotation or lateral movement.

### Step-by-Step: Guide Rails

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body → "GuideRail_Left"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XZ_Plane (Vertical plane)

#### 3. Draw Rail Profile

**Rectangular profile:**

- Rectangle
- Width: 15mm (rail width)
- Height: 25mm (rail height)
- Position appropriate to yoke edge

#### 4. Extrude (Pad)

- Pad direction: Along Y-axis
- Length: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.GuideLength`

#### 5. Create Second Rail

Repeat for "GuideRail_Right":
- Mirror geometry or create separately
- Position on opposite side of yoke path

---

## Part 7: Creating the Base Frame

<InArticleAd />


### Frame Design Intent

Fixed mounting with:
- Crank shaft bearing mount
- Guide rail mounting surfaces
- Stable base

### Step-by-Step: Frame

#### 1. Create Body

- Body: "Frame"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Base Plate

- Rectangle
- Width: 250mm
- Height: 150mm
- Centered at origin

**Crank shaft hole:**

- Circle at appropriate position
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ShaftRadius` + clearance

Position the shaft hole considering:
- Yoke centerline height
- Crank pin height when at top/bottom of rotation

**Guide mounting features:**

- Flat surfaces or mounting holes for guide rails
- Position to align with yoke sides

#### 4. Close and Pad

- Pad: 20mm (frame thickness)

---

## Part 8: Assembly

### Assembly Strategy

1. Fix frame
2. Crank rotates about shaft on frame
3. Yoke slides horizontally, guided by rails
4. Crank pin engages yoke slot

### Step-by-Step: Assembly

#### 1. Assembly Workbench

#### 2. Add Parts

- Frame
- Crank
- Yoke
- GuideRail_Left
- GuideRail_Right

#### 3. Apply Constraints

**Fix frame:**

- Frame: Fixed

**Crank rotation:**

- Crank shaft hole → Frame shaft hole: Axial align
- Allows crank to rotate about vertical axis

**Yoke linear motion:**

- Yoke → Guide rails: Constrain to allow only horizontal translation
- Use Plane constraints or Linear movement constraint
- No rotation allowed

**Pin-in-slot connection (conceptual):**

In FreeCAD assembly, continuous sliding contact isn't automatically simulated. Position yoke such that crank pin is within the slot.

### Test Motion

**Manual verification:**

1. **Crank at 0°:** Pin at rightmost position, yoke at maximum right
2. **Crank at 90°:** Pin at top, yoke at center
3. **Crank at 180°:** Pin at left, yoke at maximum left
4. **Crank at 270°:** Pin at bottom, yoke at center
5. **Crank at 360°:** Returns to start

Verify yoke travels exactly from -CrankRadius to +CrankRadius (total = Stroke).

---

## Part 9: Technical Drawing

### Creating Scotch Yoke Drawing

#### 1. TechDraw Workbench

#### 2. Create Page

- A3_Landscape

#### 3. Add Assembly Views

**Front view:**

- Shows yoke, crank, guides
- Clear view of slot and pin engagement

**Side view:**

- Shows thickness of components

**Section view:**

- Section through slot showing pin clearance

#### 4. Add Motion Diagram

Create diagram showing 4 positions:

```
θ = 0°: x = 0 (center)
θ = 90°: x = +r (max right)
θ = 180°: x = 0 (center)
θ = 270°: x = -r (max left)
```

Plot sinusoidal curve: x vs. θ

#### 5. Dimension Critical Features

- Stroke (80mm)
- Crank radius (40mm)
- Slot width and length
- Clearances

#### 6. Add Functional Notes

- "Motion: Pure sinusoidal"
- "Stroke = 2 × Crank Radius"
- "Slot clearance: 2mm"

#### 7. Export

- PDF

---

## Part 10: Testing Parametric Control

### Change Crank Radius

1. Open Spreadsheet
2. Change CrankRadius from 40 to 50mm
3. Recompute

**Automatic updates:**
- Stroke increases to 100mm
- Slot length increases
- Crank pin position updates

### Change Slot Clearance

- Modify the formula for SlotWidth
- Try: =B4+3 (3mm clearance instead of 2mm)
- Looser fit

### Verify Stroke

**Manual check:**

At θ = 0°: yoke at x = 0
At θ = 90°: yoke should be at x = CrankRadius

Measure in assembly to verify!

## Learning Outcomes

<InArticleAd />


By completing this lesson, you have:

- ✅ Designed slot-driven motion mechanisms
- ✅ Created clearance-aware sliding contact geometry
- ✅ Implemented stroke-based parametric control
- ✅ Modeled rotational and linear sliding motion together
- ✅ Designed functional clearances for smooth operation
- ✅ Tested mechanism through full motion range
- ✅ Documented sliding contact systems with clearances
- ✅ Understood sinusoidal motion generation through geometry

---

## Design Verification

1. **Does the slot accommodate full pin travel (stroke = 2r)?**
2. **Is slot width = pin diameter + adequate clearance?**
3. **When CrankRadius changes, does stroke update correctly (Stroke = 2r)?**
4. **Can the crank rotate 360° without pin binding in slot?**
5. **Are guide rails long enough for full yoke travel?**

---

## Mathematical Analysis

### Motion Equations

**Displacement:**
```
x(θ) = r × sin(θ)

Where:
x = yoke position from center
r = crank radius
θ = crank angle
```

**Velocity:**
```
v(θ) = r × ω × cos(θ)

Where:
ω = angular velocity of crank (rad/s)
```

**Acceleration:**
```
a(θ) = -r × ω² × sin(θ)
```

**Key insight:** Acceleration is proportional and opposite to displacement, characteristic of simple harmonic motion!

### Force Analysis

**Sliding friction force:**
```
F_friction = μ × N

Where:
μ = coefficient of friction (slot/pin interface)
N = normal force from pin on slot sides
```

To reduce friction:
- Use low-friction materials (bronze bushings)
- Lubrication
- Roller bearings in slot (advanced design)

---

## Challenges for Further Practice

1. **Add roller bearings** in slot ends for reduced friction
2. **Design a double Scotch yoke** (two opposing yokes for balance)
3. **Create a variable-stroke version** (adjustable crank radius)
4. **Add a flywheel** to crank for smooth operation
5. **Model with FEM analysis** (stress in yoke at extreme positions)
6. **Design a 90° Scotch yoke** (vertical yoke, horizontal crank axis)
7. **Add lubrication ports** in slot

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Pin binds in slot"

- **Cause:** Insufficient slot clearance or slot too short
- **Solution:** Increase SlotWidth (add 1-2mm clearance)
- **Fix:** Ensure SlotLength > Stroke + margin

### "Yoke rotates instead of sliding linearly"

- **Cause:** Guides not constraining rotation
- **Solution:** Add guide constraints in assembly
- **Fix:** Ensure yoke has contact surfaces for guide rails

### "Slot width inconsistent"

- **Cause:** Slot not properly dimensioned or constrained
- **Solution:** Use Symmetric constraint to center slot
- **Fix:** Link SlotWidth to PinDiameter via spreadsheet formula

### "Crank pin doesn't stay in slot during rotation"

- **Cause:** In CAD assembly, continuous contact not auto-maintained
- **Solution:** This is expected in static CAD assembly
- **Note:** In real mechanism, pin is physically captured in slot
- **For verification:** Position yoke manually at several crank angles to verify geometry
