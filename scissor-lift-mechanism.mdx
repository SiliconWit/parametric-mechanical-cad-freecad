# Scissor Lift Mechanism - Parametric CAD Design

## Engineering Context

### Why This Mechanism Matters

Scissor lift mechanisms provide vertical motion through a compact, stable structure using multiple interconnected linkages. They're fundamental to many height-adjustment and material handling applications.

**Real-world applications:**
- Vehicle scissor jacks
- Aerial work platforms (scissor lifts)
- Adjustable work tables and desks
- Stage platforms and theatrical equipment
- Medical examination tables
- Warehouse loading platforms

### Engineering Problem

**Given:** Limited horizontal space for vertical lifting
**Required:** Stable vertical motion with significant height change
**Constraint:** Compact when collapsed, strong when extended

### Mechanism Principles

A scissor mechanism consists of crossed links (X-shaped pairs) connected in series. Key characteristics:

**Motion amplification:**
- Small horizontal input → Large vertical output
- Multiple stages multiply the lift height

**Stability:**
- Wide base when collapsed
- Load distributed across multiple pivot points

**Mechanical advantage:**
- Force amplification when raising loads
- Self-locking potential in certain configurations

### Key Parameters

The behavior is controlled by:

- **Link length (L)** - Length of each scissor arm
- **Link width (W)** - Width of the link structure
- **Number of stages (N)** - How many X-pairs in series
- **Minimum angle (θ_min)** - Collapsed position angle
- **Maximum angle (θ_max)** - Extended position angle

**Height relationship:**
```
Collapsed height: H_min = 2N × L × sin(θ_min)
Extended height: H_max = 2N × L × sin(θ_max)
```

---

## Part 1: FreeCAD Setup

### Starting Fresh

1. Launch FreeCAD
2. Create new document: File → New
3. Save as "ScissorLift.FCStd"

### Workbenches for This Lesson

- **Part Design** - Individual parts
- **Sketcher** - Constrained 2D sketches
- **Spreadsheet** - Parameter control
- **Assembly** - Combining multiple instances
- **TechDraw** - Documentation

---

## Part 2: Design Strategy

### Single Stage vs. Multiple Stages

We'll design:
1. One parametric scissor link
2. Assemble a single X-pair (one stage)
3. Repeat for multiple stages
4. Add base and top platforms

### Parametric Philosophy

Instead of creating each stage separately, we'll:
- Design ONE perfect link
- Use that link multiple times
- Control everything from the spreadsheet

### Our Parameters

```
ArmLength = 200 mm       (scissor arm length)
ArmWidth = 30 mm         (arm plate width)
ArmThickness = 8 mm      (arm plate thickness)
PinDiameter = 8 mm       (pivot pin diameter)
StageCount = 2           (number of X-pairs)
```

---

## Part 3: Parameter Spreadsheet

### Creating the Spreadsheet

1. **Switch to Part Design workbench**

2. **Insert spreadsheet:**
   - Insert → Spreadsheet
   - Double-click to open

3. **Enter parameters:**

```
A1: Parameter          B1: Value    C1: Unit
A2: ArmLength          B2: 200      C2: mm
A3: ArmWidth           B3: 30       C3: mm
A4: ArmThickness       B4: 8        C4: mm
A5: PinDiameter        B5: 8        C5: mm
A6: PinRadius          B6: =B5/2    C6: mm
A7: StageCount         B7: 2        C7: count
A8: BaseWidth          B8: 400      C8: mm

   - B4: `ArmThickness`
   - B5: `PinDiameter`
   - B6: `PinRadius`
   - B7: `StageCount`
   - B8: `BaseWidth`
   - B9: `BaseThickness`

5. **Close spreadsheet**

## Part 4: Designing the Scissor Arm

<InArticleAd />


### Arm Design Intent

Each arm is a rectangular link with three holes:
1. **Center hole** - Where arms cross (intersection point)
2. **End hole 1** - Connects to base or adjacent stage
3. **End hole 2** - Connects to top platform or adjacent stage

### Step-by-Step: Scissor Arm

#### 1. Create Body

- Switch to Part Design
- Create Body
- Rename: "ScissorArm"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Center Line (Construction)

**Horizontal reference:**

- Line tool (L)
- Draw from origin horizontally right
- Make horizontal (H key)
- Coincident: left end at origin

**Dimension:**

- Length constraint
- ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ArmLength`

**Make construction:**

- Select the line
- Press G (construction geometry)
- Turns blue/dashed

This line is our reference axis.

#### 4. Add Pin Holes

**Center hole:**

- Circle tool
- Place at midpoint of the line
- Escape

**Constrain:**

- Midpoint constraint
- Circle center → line midpoint
- Radius = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

**End hole 1:**

- Circle tool
- Place at left end (origin)
- Escape

**Constrain:**

- Coincident: center → origin
- Radius = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

**End hole 2:**

- Circle tool
- Place at right end
- Escape

**Constrain:**

- Coincident: center → right endpoint of line
- Radius = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

#### 5. Draw Arm Body

**Rectangle for arm plate:**

- Rectangle tool
- Draw rectangle around the line and circles
- Should encompass all three holes

**Symmetric constraint:**

- Symmetric constraint
- Select top edge of rectangle
- Select bottom edge of rectangle
- Select the horizontal centerline
- This centers the rectangle about the axis

**Dimension width:**

- Distance constraint
- Top edge to bottom edge
- ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ArmWidth`

**Fix the ends:**

The rectangle length is already defined by the coincident constraints of the end holes at the line endpoints.

#### 6. Check and Close

- Sketch should be fully constrained
- Close sketch

#### 7. Pad the Arm

- Select sketch in tree
- Pad tool
- Length: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ArmThickness`
- OK

You now have one scissor arm!

---

## Part 5: Creating the Base Platform

### Design Intent

Rectangular base with:
- Pin mounts for bottom ends of first stage arms
- Stable, wide footprint

### Step-by-Step: Base Platform

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body
- Rename: "BasePlatform"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Base Rectangle

- Rectangle tool centered at origin
- Use Symmetric constraints (both horizontal and vertical about axes)
- Width = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseWidth`
- Height = 60mm (or smaller value for depth)

#### 4. Add Pin Mount Holes

For a 1-stage lift, you need two pin holes for the bottom pivot points of the scissor arms.

- Draw circles at appropriate positions
- Spacing should match scissor geometry when collapsed
- Radius = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

(Exact positions depend on desired collapsed angle - for simplicity, place at -80mm and +80mm from center on X-axis)

#### 5. Close and Pad

- Close sketch
- Pad: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseThickness`

---

## Part 6: Creating the Top Platform

### Design Intent

Similar to base, but attaches to top ends of scissor arms.

### Step-by-Step: Top Platform

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body
- Rename: "TopPlatform"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Platform

- Similar rectangle to base
- Width = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseWidth` (or separate TopWidth parameter)
- Height = 60mm

#### 4. Add Pin Holes

- Positions match the top pivots of the scissor mechanism
- Radius = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

#### 5. Pad

- Thickness = ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseThickness`

---

## Part 7: Assembly - Single Stage

### Assembly Strategy

First, assemble a single scissor stage to understand the geometry.

### Step-by-Step: Single Stage Assembly

#### 1. Switch to Assembly Workbench

#### 2. Create Assembly

#### 3. Add Parts

You need:
- 2 × ScissorArm (we'll add the same part twice)
- 1 × BasePlatform
- 1 × TopPlatform

**Add ScissorArm twice:**
- Right-click ScissorArm in tree → "Duplicate Object" or use Assembly4's "Add Part" twice

#### 4. Position and Constrain

**Fix the base:**

- Select BasePlatform
- Fixed constraint

**First arm (left-to-right rising):**

- Bottom-left hole → Base left pin mount (Axial align)

**Second arm (right-to-left rising):**

- Bottom-right hole → Base right pin mount (Axial align)

**Cross connection (center pivots):**

- First arm center hole → Second arm center hole (Axial align)
- This is where they cross!

**Top connections:**

- First arm top hole → TopPlatform right pin (Axial align)
- Second arm top hole → TopPlatform left pin (Axial align)

### Test Motion

The platform should lift as you adjust the angle!

## Part 8: Multi-Stage Assembly (Advanced)

### Adding More Stages

To create a 2-stage lift:
1. Add 2 more ScissorArm copies (4 arms total for 2 stages)
2. The top of stage 1 connects to the bottom of stage 2
3. Repeat the crossing pattern

This gets complex quickly - in practice, use assembly patterns or spreadsheet-driven positioning.

### Simplified Approach

For this lesson, completing a 1-stage scissor lift demonstrates all the key principles. Multi-stage is a scaling exercise.

## Part 9: Technical Drawing

<InArticleAd />


### Creating Assembly Drawing

#### 1. Switch to TechDraw

#### 2. Create Page

- Insert Page
- Template: A3_Landscape (assembly drawings need space)

#### 3. Add Assembly Views

- Insert View
- Select the entire assembly
- Front view (collapsed position)
- Side view

#### 4. Add Detail View

- Create detail view of one arm
- Show dimensions and hole positions

#### 5. Add Parts List

Many TechDraw templates include parts list tables:
- Fill in: Part name, Quantity, Material

**Example:**
| Part | Qty | Material |
|------|-----|----------|
| Scissor Arm | 2 | Steel |
| Base Platform | 1 | Steel |
| Top Platform | 1 | Steel |
| Pin | 5 | Steel |

#### 6. Export

- Export as PDF

## Part 10: Testing Parametric Control

### Changing Arm Length

1. Open Spreadsheet
2. Change ArmLength from 200 to 250
3. Recompute (Ctrl+R)
4. All arms and mechanism update!

### Changing Arm Width

- Try ArmWidth = 40mm
- Wider, more robust arms

### Changing Stage Count (Conceptual)

The StageCount parameter is included for future expansion. To actually implement it would require:
- Array/pattern features in assembly
- Or scripting to duplicate parts

For now, it serves as documentation of design intent.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, you have:

- ✅ Designed a symmetric parametric link
- ✅ Created repeating geometry with multiple instances
- ✅ Assembled a pin-jointed collapsible mechanism
- ✅ Used symmetry constraints effectively
- ✅ Managed multiple copies of the same part
- ✅ Created assembly documentation with parts list
- ✅ Understood motion amplification in scissor mechanisms

---

## Design Verification

1. **Does the scissor mechanism collapse and expand smoothly?**
2. **Are all pin holes aligned correctly?**
3. **When you change ArmLength, does the mechanism update without errors?**
4. **Is the base stable (wide enough)?**
5. **Can you calculate the theoretical lift height based on arm length and angle?**

---

## Challenges for Further Practice

1. **Add a second stage** (4 arms total) for double lift height
2. **Design a pin** as a separate part (cylinder with head)
3. **Add a linear actuator** mechanism to drive the scissor action
4. **Create an exploded view** showing assembly sequence
5. **Add safety locks** at different height positions
6. **Calculate and display** mechanical advantage at different angles

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Arms don't align at center crossing"

- **Cause:** Center hole not exactly at midpoint
- **Solution:** Use Midpoint constraint, not manual positioning
- **Fix:** Re-constrain center hole to line midpoint

### "Platform holes don't match arm holes"

- **Cause:** Inconsistent spacing or radius
- **Solution:** Use same PinRadius parameter for all holes
- **Fix:** Check all pin holes reference `Spreadsheet.PinRadius`

### "Mechanism binds/won't move smoothly"

- **Cause:** Over-constrained assembly or interference
- **Solution:** Check that only base is Fixed, all pins are Axial align
- **Fix:** Remove redundant constraints

### "Cannot duplicate ScissorArm"

- **Solution:** In Part Design, use Std_DuplicateSelection or in Assembly workbench use "Add Part" multiple times referencing same part

## Next Steps

In the next lesson on **Toggle Clamp Mechanism**, we'll explore:

- Over-center mechanisms
- Mechanical advantage and force amplification
- Locking geometry
- Motion limits and clearances
- Angle-based constraints
