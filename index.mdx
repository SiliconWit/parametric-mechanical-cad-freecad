**Parametric Mechanical CAD with FreeCAD** teaches engineering design methodology by building **complete, functional mechanical mechanisms** with dimensions derived from kinematic analysis, manufacturing constraints, and engineering requirements, not arbitrary values or aesthetic preference.

Rather than learning FreeCAD tools in isolation, each lesson is built around **one fundamental mechanical mechanism** taken from real-world engineering practice. You learn **why** each dimension exists (kinematics, strength, manufacturability), **how** to implement it in CAD (sketching, constraints, assemblies), and **what** engineering decisions justify it (calculations, standards, analysis). No prior CAD experience required, but expect to think like an engineer from day one.

## Lesson Structure & Approach

Each lesson follows a mechanism-first pedagogical approach:

<Steps>
1. **🔧 Engineering Context**
   Begin with the real-world mechanism and understand why it matters in engineering practice.

2. **📚 Mechanical Theory**
   Learn the fundamental principles of how the mechanism works—kinematics, motion relationships, and key parameters.

3. **🎯 CAD Implementation**
   Apply FreeCAD tools step-by-step to model the mechanism parametrically from scratch.

4. **🛠️ Assembly & Documentation**
   Create proper assemblies with motion constraints and generate technical drawings suitable for manufacturing.
</Steps>

## Learning Path

<Steps>
1. **Master FreeCAD Fundamentals**
   Learn sketching, constraints, and Part Design workflow through practical mechanism design.

2. **Build Parametric Thinking**
   Develop the habit of thinking in terms of design intent, constraints, and parametric control.

3. **Create Reusable Designs**

## Pedagogical Philosophy

<Card title="🎯 Core Principles" icon="star">
- **Mechanism-first, tool-second**: Learn CAD by doing real design
- **Complete designs, not partial exercises**: Every lesson produces a functional mechanism
- **Parametric thinking from the start**: Build models that change correctly
- **Engineering intent over visual appearance**: Focus on function and correctness
- **Reusable designs over one-off models**: Create a library of mechanisms you can use
</Card>

Each lesson can be taken independently, yet together they form a coherent progression from simpler geometry and motion to more complex kinematic behavior.

By the end of the course, learners will not just know how to use FreeCAD. They will have designed a **library of reusable mechanical elements** and developed the habit of thinking in terms of **design intent, constraints, and parametric control**.

This mirrors real engineering practice, where CAD is not about drawing shapes, but about building **systems that change correctly**.

### CAD Is Engineering Design Documentation, Not 3D Art

<Card title="⚠️ Critical Distinction" icon="warning">

**Computer-Aided Design is not computer-aided drawing.** Creating a 3D object on a computer is trivial. Engineering design demands that **every dimension, feature, and material choice has a defensible engineering rationale.**

A crank radius is not "50mm because it looks good." It is 50mm because:
- **Kinematic analysis** showed this stroke length meets force-displacement requirements
- **Stress calculations** confirmed the shaft can handle the torque at this radius
- **Manufacturing constraints** allow standard bearings at this size
- **Cost analysis** showed optimal material usage at this dimension
- **Assembly clearances** were verified against adjacent components

**Similarly:** Replicating someone else's CAD model on your computer is valuable CAD software practice, but it is not engineering design until you understand *why* each dimension exists. Creating visually sophisticated 3D models demonstrates software proficiency, not engineering competence. Engineering CAD requires you to derive dimensions from requirements, not copy them from examples or choose them for appearance.

</Card>

:::note[What Separates Engineering CAD from 3D Modeling]
**3D Modeling (Blender, Maya):**
- Dimensions chosen for visual aesthetics
- "Does it look right?" is the validation criterion
- Focus on appearance, rendering, animation

**Engineering CAD (FreeCAD, SolidWorks):**
- Dimensions derived from calculations, standards, or constraints
- "Does it function correctly and can it be manufactured?" is the validation criterion
- Focus on performance, tolerances, assemblies, manufacturing
:::

**Every dimension in this course exists for a reason:**
- **Crank radius** → determines stroke length and mechanical advantage (kinematics)
- **Rod length-to-crank ratio** → affects side forces and motion smoothness (dynamics)
- **Pin diameters** → calculated from shear stress and bearing pressure (strength of materials)
- **Clearances** → based on tolerance stack-up analysis (manufacturing)
- **Material selection** → driven by stress, fatigue, and cost requirements (materials science)
- **Hole patterns** → follow fastener standards and accessibility (assembly/maintenance)

:::tip[Engineering Design Process]
Before creating any CAD geometry, engineers ask:
1. **Functional requirements** - What must this mechanism do? (forces, motion, speed)
2. **Constraints** - What limits exist? (space, weight, cost, manufacturing capability)
3. **Analysis** - What math/physics governs this? (kinematics, strength, thermal, fluid)
4. **Standards compliance** - What codes/regulations apply? (safety, industry standards)
5. **Manufacturability** - How will this be made? (tolerances, processes, tooling access)
6. **Lifecycle** - How is it assembled, maintained, replaced? (ergonomics, serviceability)

Only after answering these questions do you open CAD software. **CAD documents engineering decisions; it does not make them.**
:::

:::note[Experience and Engineering Judgment]
With accumulated experience and domain expertise, engineers develop the ability to make informed estimates without detailed calculations for every dimension. A senior mechanical engineer might specify a shaft diameter based on pattern recognition from dozens of similar designs, material familiarity, and intuitive understanding of stress distributions.

**This is fundamentally different from arbitrary choice** because it is grounded in internalized engineering knowledge, industry standards, and prior analysis. The engineer could still justify the decision if challenged ("similar successful designs," "within safe stress limits for this material," "standard bearing size availability"). The estimate is defensible, traceable to engineering principles, and rooted in experience.

As a learner, you must first understand *why* before you can reliably estimate. This course builds that foundation.
:::

This course teaches you to think like an engineer using CAD as the documentation tool, not like an artist using CAD as a 3D canvas. You will justify dimensions with math, verify assemblies with motion studies, and generate drawings that communicate manufacturing intent.

## Why FreeCAD Over Alternatives?

This course uses **FreeCAD** instead of commercial CAD (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Inventor) or free 3D software (Blender) for evidence-based reasons:

### ✅ **Parametric Engineering CAD, Not Mesh Modeling**

**FreeCAD:** True parametric constraint-based CAD for mechanical engineering
- Designs defined by dimensions, constraints, and relationships
- Change one parameter → entire design updates correctly
- Engineering intent preserved (e.g., "holes always concentric," "wall thickness constant")

**Blender:** Free but mesh-based modeling for animation/visual effects
- Not parametric—moving vertices manually
- No constraint solver or dimensional control
- Excellent for art/rendering, wrong tool for mechanical engineering

**Commercial CAD (SolidWorks, Fusion 360):** Parametric, but costly and restrictive (see below)

### ✅ **Freedom & Accessibility**

- ✅ Privacy; no telemetry, forced account creation, or data collection
- ✅ Offline capability; works without internet connection

### ⚠️ **Honest Limitations**

FreeCAD is **actively developed** but less mature than decades-old commercial CAD (SolidWorks since 1995, Inventor since 1999). Some manufacturers' workflows and machines integrate better with commercial CAD file formats and ecosystems. **However:** FreeCAD's STEP/IGES/STL export and standard engineering drawings are sufficient for manufacturing most designs you'll ever build, **provided you understand manufacturers' engineering requirements and communicate tolerances, materials, and processes clearly.** The limitation is rarely the software, but understanding manufacturing constraints.

**This course teaches engineering CAD methodology and manufacturing-aware design, not necessarily vendor-specific buttons.**
