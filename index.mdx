**Parametric Mechanical CAD with FreeCAD** teaches parametric mechanical CAD by designing **complete, functional mechanical mechanisms** that appear repeatedly in real engineering machines.

Rather than learning FreeCAD tools in isolation, each lesson is built around **one fundamental mechanical mechanism**, taken from real-world engineering practice. The CAD skills, theory, and workflow required to design that mechanism are introduced **within the same lesson**, with no assumed prior experience.

## Lesson Structure & Approach

Each lesson follows a mechanism-first pedagogical approach:

<Steps>
1. **🔧 Engineering Context**
   Begin with the real-world mechanism and understand why it matters in engineering practice.

2. **📚 Mechanical Theory**
   Learn the fundamental principles of how the mechanism works—kinematics, motion relationships, and key parameters.

3. **🎯 CAD Implementation**
   Apply FreeCAD tools step-by-step to model the mechanism parametrically from scratch.

4. **🛠️ Assembly & Documentation**
   Create proper assemblies with motion constraints and generate technical drawings suitable for manufacturing.
</Steps>

## Learning Path

<Steps>
1. **Master FreeCAD Fundamentals**
   Learn sketching, constraints, and Part Design workflow through practical mechanism design.

2. **Build Parametric Thinking**
   Develop the habit of thinking in terms of design intent, constraints, and parametric control.

3. **Create Reusable Designs**
   Build a library of mechanisms that change correctly when parameters are modified.

4. **Apply Engineering Practice**
   Use assemblies, technical drawings, and documentation as done in professional engineering.
</Steps>

9. **[Python Scripting for Advanced CAD](./python-scripting-advanced-cad)**
   Unlock FreeCAD's computational power with Python scripting. Generate mathematically-perfect gears, create lattice structures, automate design optimization, and perform batch operations impossible with GUI alone. Learn algorithmic design for research and advanced engineering.
</Steps>

## Pedagogical Philosophy

<Card title="🎯 Core Principles" icon="star">
- **Mechanism-first, tool-second**: Learn CAD by doing real design
- **Complete designs, not partial exercises**: Every lesson produces a functional mechanism
- **Parametric thinking from the start**: Build models that change correctly
- **Engineering intent over visual appearance**: Focus on function and correctness
- **Reusable designs over one-off models**: Create a library of mechanisms you can use
</Card>

Each lesson can be taken independently, yet together they form a coherent progression from simpler geometry and motion to more complex kinematic behavior.

By the end of the course, learners will not just know how to use FreeCAD. They will have designed a **library of reusable mechanical elements** and developed the habit of thinking in terms of **design intent, constraints, and parametric control**.

This mirrors real engineering practice, where CAD is not about drawing shapes, but about building **systems that change correctly**.

## Why FreeCAD Over Alternatives?

This course uses **FreeCAD** instead of commercial CAD (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Inventor) or free 3D software (Blender) for evidence-based reasons:

### ✅ **Parametric Engineering CAD, Not Mesh Modeling**

**FreeCAD:** True parametric constraint-based CAD for mechanical engineering
- Designs defined by dimensions, constraints, and relationships
- Change one parameter → entire design updates correctly
- Engineering intent preserved (e.g., "holes always concentric," "wall thickness constant")

**Blender:** Free but mesh-based modeling for animation/visual effects
- Not parametric—moving vertices manually
- No constraint solver or dimensional control
- Excellent for art/rendering, wrong tool for mechanical engineering

**Commercial CAD (SolidWorks, Fusion 360):** Parametric, but costly and restrictive (see below)

### ✅ **Freedom & Accessibility**

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="💰 Zero Cost, Forever" icon="approve-check">
    **FreeCAD:** Completely free (GPL), no restrictions

    **Commercial alternatives:** Subscription-based pricing models requiring ongoing payments; "free" tiers often have feature restrictions and can be modified or revoked
  </Card>

  <Card title="🔓 Data Sovereignty" icon="document">
    **FreeCAD:** Your files, locally stored, no account required

    **Some alternatives:** Cloud-based storage models requiring internet connectivity; your design data resides on vendor servers
  </Card>

  <Card title="🐧 True Cross-Platform" icon="laptop">
    **FreeCAD:** Windows, macOS, **Linux**

    **Many alternatives:** Limited to specific operating systems; Linux support often unavailable (critical for ROS, research, embedded systems)
  </Card>

  <Card title="🐍 Python Scripting" icon="seti:python">
    Native Python API for computational design—generate gears, lattices, optimization

    Integrates with NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib for engineering computation
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### ✅ **Engineering Capabilities**

- **Parametric Part Design:** Sketch-based features with constraint solver
- **Assembly Modeling:** Multi-part assemblies with motion constraints
- **Technical Drawings:** Engineering drawings with dimensions, tolerances, annotations
- **FEM Analysis:** Built-in finite element analysis (CalculiX integration)
- **CAM Manufacturing:** Toolpath generation for CNC machining
- **STEP/IGES/STL Export:** Industry-standard formats for collaboration

**Educational advantages:**
- ✅ Students use it **after graduation** (no license expiration)
- ✅ Works in **startups and low-income regions** without budget barriers
- ✅ No vendor lock-in (Autodesk discontinued 123D Design, Inventor LT, AutoCAD)
- ✅ Open-source transparency; inspect algorithms, contribute features, community-driven development
- ✅ Privacy; no telemetry, forced account creation, or data collection
- ✅ Offline capability; works without internet connection

### ⚠️ **Honest Limitations**

FreeCAD is **actively developed** but less mature than decades-old commercial CAD (SolidWorks since 1995, Inventor since 1999). Some manufacturers' workflows and machines integrate better with commercial CAD file formats and ecosystems. **However:** FreeCAD's STEP/IGES/STL export and standard engineering drawings are sufficient for manufacturing most designs you'll ever build, **provided you understand manufacturers' engineering requirements and communicate tolerances, materials, and processes clearly.** The limitation is rarely the software, but understanding manufacturing constraints.

**This course teaches engineering CAD methodology and manufacturing-aware design, not necessarily vendor-specific buttons.**
