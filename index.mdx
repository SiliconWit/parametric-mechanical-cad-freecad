**Parametric Mechanical CAD with FreeCAD** teaches parametric mechanical CAD by designing **complete, functional mechanical mechanisms** that appear repeatedly in real engineering machines.

Rather than learning FreeCAD tools in isolation, each lesson is built around **one fundamental mechanical mechanism**, taken from real-world engineering practice. The CAD skills, theory, and workflow required to design that mechanism are introduced **within the same lesson**, with no assumed prior experience.

## Lesson Structure & Approach

Each lesson follows a mechanism-first pedagogical approach:

<Steps>
1. **🔧 Engineering Context**
   Begin with the real-world mechanism and understand why it matters in engineering practice.

2. **📚 Mechanical Theory**
   Learn the fundamental principles of how the mechanism works—kinematics, motion relationships, and key parameters.

3. **🎯 CAD Implementation**
   Apply FreeCAD tools step-by-step to model the mechanism parametrically from scratch.

4. **🛠️ Assembly & Documentation**
   Create proper assemblies with motion constraints and generate technical drawings suitable for manufacturing.
</Steps>

## Learning Path

<Steps>
1. **Master FreeCAD Fundamentals**
   Learn sketching, constraints, and Part Design workflow through practical mechanism design.

2. **Build Parametric Thinking**
   Develop the habit of thinking in terms of design intent, constraints, and parametric control.

3. **Create Reusable Designs**
   Build a library of mechanisms that change correctly when parameters are modified.

4. **Apply Engineering Practice**
   Use assemblies, technical drawings, and documentation as done in professional engineering.
</Steps>

## Lessons

<Steps>
1. **[Slider Crank Mechanism](./slider-crank-mechanism)**
   The most common motion-conversion mechanism, used in engines, compressors, and pumps. Learn FreeCAD interface, sketching, constraints, part design, parameter tables, basic assemblies, and technical drawings.

2. **[Four-Bar Linkage Mechanism](./four-bar-linkage-mechanism)**
   Fundamental to hinges, folding systems, and mechanical linkages. Master construction geometry, master-sketch driven design, spreadsheet parameter control, and pin-jointed assemblies.

3. **[Scissor Lift Mechanism](./scissor-lift-mechanism)**
   Used in lifts, adjustable platforms, and deployable structures. Build repeating parametric geometry, manage symmetry, control stage count via parameters, and understand motion amplification.

4. **[Toggle Clamp Mechanism](./toggle-clamp-mechanism)**
   Widely used in manufacturing fixtures for locking and force amplification. Design with angle-based constraints, clearance-aware geometry, motion limits, and over-center locking behavior.

5. **[Pantograph Mechanism](./pantograph-mechanism)**
   Scales motion in copying and tracing mechanisms. Implement ratio-driven parameter relationships, similar triangle geometry, and expression-linked dimensions across assemblies.

6. **[Cam and Follower Mechanism](./cam-and-follower-mechanism)**
   Fundamental to timed motion in engines and automated machinery. Master curve-based sketching, datum axes, parametric cam profile control, and motion-defining geometry documentation.

7. **[Geneva Mechanism](./geneva-mechanism)**
   Provides precise intermittent motion and indexing. Design with polar geometry, pattern-based features, angular constraints, and locking geometry for intermittent motion control.

8. **[Scotch Yoke Mechanism](./scotch-yoke-mechanism)**
   Offers compact rotation-to-linear conversion with pure sinusoidal characteristics. Create slot-driven motion geometry, clearance considerations, and stroke-based parameterization.

9. **[Python Scripting for Advanced CAD](./python-scripting-advanced-cad)**
   Unlock FreeCAD's computational power with Python scripting. Generate mathematically-perfect gears, create lattice structures, automate design optimization, and perform batch operations impossible with GUI alone. Learn algorithmic design for research and advanced engineering.
</Steps>

## Pedagogical Philosophy

<Card title="🎯 Core Principles" icon="star">
- **Mechanism-first, tool-second**: Learn CAD by doing real design
- **Complete designs, not partial exercises**: Every lesson produces a functional mechanism
- **Parametric thinking from the start**: Build models that change correctly
- **Engineering intent over visual appearance**: Focus on function and correctness
- **Reusable designs over one-off models**: Create a library of mechanisms you can use
</Card>

Each lesson can be taken independently, yet together they form a coherent progression from simpler geometry and motion to more complex kinematic behavior.

By the end of the course, learners will not just know how to use FreeCAD. They will have designed a **library of reusable mechanical elements** and developed the habit of thinking in terms of **design intent, constraints, and parametric control**.

This mirrors real engineering practice, where CAD is not about drawing shapes, but about building **systems that change correctly**.
