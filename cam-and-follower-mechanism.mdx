# Cam and Follower Mechanism - Parametric CAD Design

## Engineering Context

### Why This Mechanism Matters

Cam and follower mechanisms convert continuous rotary motion into precisely controlled reciprocating or oscillating motion. They're fundamental to timing and sequencing in mechanical systems.

**Real-world applications:**
- Engine valve trains (opening/closing valves at precise times)
- Automated assembly machines (pick-and-place motion)
- CNC machine tool changers
- Textile machinery (needle control)
- Printing presses (paper feed timing)
- Packaging equipment (synchronized cutting/sealing)

### Engineering Problem

**Given:** Continuous rotating motion (motor drive)
**Required:** Specific follower motion profile (rise, dwell, return, dwell)
**Constraint:** Motion must be smooth, repeatable, and precisely timed

### Cam Mechanism Principle

**Motion Programming Through Geometry:**

The cam profile directly determines follower motion. As the cam rotates, its surface pushes the follower according to the cam's shape.

**Key concept:** Cam profile = motion program encoded as geometry

### Motion Profiles

A complete cam cycle typically includes:

1. **Rise:** Follower moves outward (lift)
2. **Dwell:** Follower remains stationary while cam continues rotating
3. **Return:** Follower moves inward (descent)
4. **Dwell:** Follower remains at bottom

### Types of Followers

- **Flat-faced follower:** Flat contact surface
- **Roller follower:** Rolling contact (reduces friction)
- **Knife-edge follower:** Point contact (theoretical, impractical due to wear)

For this lesson: Roller follower (most common).

### Types of Cams

- **Plate cam (disk cam):** Rotating disk with profiled edge
- **Cylindrical cam:** Grooved cylinder
- **Linear cam:** Reciprocating cam

For this lesson: Plate cam.

### Key Parameters

- **Base circle radius (R_b):** Minimum cam radius (determines minimum follower position)
- **Lift (L):** Maximum follower displacement
- **Prime circle radius (R_p):** Base circle + lift
- **Cam rotation angle:** 360° for one complete cycle
- **Rise angle, dwell angles, return angle:** Define timing

---

## Part 4: Designing the Cam Profile

### Understanding Cam Profile Design

The cam profile must be designed relative to the follower position. For a roller follower, we design the **pitch curve** (path of roller center), then the cam surface is offset inward by the roller radius.

**Simplified approach for this lesson:**

We'll sketch the cam profile directly, using arcs and curves that create the desired motion.

### Step-by-Step: Cam Profile Sketch

#### 1. Create Body

- Part Design workbench
- Create Body
- Rename: "Cam"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

We'll use polar coordinates (angles) to define the profile.

#### 3. Draw Base Circle

- Circle tool
- Center at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.BaseCircleRadius`

This is the minimum cam radius (dwell at bottom).

#### 4. Draw Rise Section (0° to 120°)

For simple harmonic motion rise, the radius varies as:

```
r(θ) = R_b + L × [1 - cos(θ × 180 / RiseAngle)] / 2
```

**In FreeCAD:** We'll approximate this with a smooth curve (B-spline) or use multiple arcs.

**Simplified method - Use construction lines and points:**

- Draw construction rays from origin at 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°
- Calculate radii at each angle using the formula above
- Place points at those radii along each ray
- Connect points with smooth spline

**Calculated radii (for RiseAngle=120°, Lift=20mm, R_b=40mm):**

| Angle | Radius |
|-------|--------|
| 0°    | 40 mm  |
| 30°   | 42.68 mm |
| 60°   | 50 mm  |
| 90°   | 57.32 mm |
| 120°  | 60 mm  |

**Draw the rise:**

- Construction lines at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° from horizontal
- Place points at calculated radii
- B-spline tool (S key) to connect points smoothly

#### 5. Draw First Dwell (120° to 180°)

- Arc tool
- Center: origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.PrimeCircleRadius` (60mm)
- Start: 120°
- End: 180°

This keeps follower at maximum lift.

#### 6. Draw Return Section (180° to 300°)

Mirror of rise section:

- Points at 180°, 210°, 240°, 270°, 300°
- Radii descend from 60mm back to 40mm
- B-spline connecting points

**Or:** Use symmetry to mirror the rise curve.

#### 7. Draw Second Dwell (300° to 360°)

- Arc tool
- Center: origin
- Radius: BaseCircleRadius (40mm)
- Start: 300°
- End: 360° (0°)

#### 8. Close the Profile

The cam profile should be a closed curve (starts and ends at 0°/360°).

#### 9. Add Shaft Hole

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ShaftRadius`

#### 10. Check and Close Sketch

- Profile should be fully constrained
- Close sketch

### Simplified Alternative

If B-splines are complex, use **circular arc approximation**:

- Rise: Single large arc from (0°, 40mm) to (120°, 60mm)
- Dwell: Circular arc at 60mm
- Return: Arc from (180°, 60mm) to (300°, 40mm)
- Dwell: Circular arc at 40mm

This gives approximate motion (not true harmonic, but functional).

#### 3. Pad the Cam

- Select sketch
- Pad tool
- Length: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.CamThickness`
- OK

Cam complete!

## Part 5: Creating the Follower

### Follower Design Intent

Roller follower consists of:
- Roller (cylinder in contact with cam)
- Follower stem (translates vertically)
- Mounting base

### Step-by-Step: Roller

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body → "Roller"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XZ_Plane (vertical plane)

Why XZ? The follower moves vertically (Z-axis) and roller rotates about Y-axis.

#### 3. Draw Roller Profile

- Circle
- Center at appropriate position (e.g., X=0, Z=60) - above cam
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.RollerRadius`

#### 4. Revolve (Not Pad!)

Rollers are cylindrical, created by revolving a circle about an axis:

- Select sketch
- **Revolve** tool (not Pad)
- Axis: Z-axis
- Angle: 360°
- OK

Roller created!

### Step-by-Step: Follower Stem

#### 1. Create Body

- Create Body → "FollowerStem"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XZ_Plane

#### 3. Draw Stem

- Rectangle
- Vertical orientation
- Width: 15mm
- Height: 80mm (long enough for full stroke + extra)
- Positioned above cam, aligned with roller

#### 4. Pad

- Direction: Perpendicular to XZ (Y-direction)
- Length: 10mm

---

## Part 6: Creating the Base Frame

### Frame Design

Fixed frame with:
- Cam shaft bearing mount
- Follower guide rails

### Step-by-Step: Frame

#### 1. Create Body

- Body: "Frame"

#### 2. Create Sketch on XY_Plane

#### 3. Draw Base Plate

- Rectangle
- Width: 150mm
- Height: 100mm
- Centered at origin

**Cam shaft hole:**

- Circle at origin
- Radius: ƒx → `Spreadsheet.ShaftRadius` + clearance (e.g., +0.5mm)

**Follower guide:**

- Vertical slot or two parallel edges
- Position to align with follower stem
- Width = stem width + clearance

#### 4. Pad

- Thickness: 20mm

---

## Part 7: Assembly

<InArticleAd />


### Assembly Strategy

- Fix frame
- Cam rotates about shaft (Z-axis) on frame
- Follower translates vertically, guided by frame
- Roller contacts cam profile

### Step-by-Step: Assembly

#### 1. Assembly Workbench

#### 2. Add Parts

- Frame
- Cam
- FollowerStem
- Roller

#### 3. Apply Constraints

**Fix frame:**

- Frame: Fixed

**Cam rotation:**

- Cam shaft hole axis → Frame shaft hole axis: Axial align
- This allows cam to rotate about Z-axis

**Follower translation:**

- Follower stem → Frame guide: Constrain to allow only Z-direction motion
- Use Plane constraints or Linear constraint

**Roller to stem:**

- Position roller at bottom of stem
- Fixed or allow rotation (if modeling roller rotation)

**Contact (conceptual):**

FreeCAD assembly doesn't simulate continuous contact automatically. Position the follower such that roller just touches the cam at base circle.

### Manual Motion Test

- Rotate cam incrementally
- Manually adjust follower height to maintain roller contact with cam
- Observe rise-dwell-return-dwell cycle

---

## Part 8: Technical Drawing

### Creating Cam Profile Drawing

#### 1. TechDraw Workbench

#### 2. Create Page

- A3_Landscape

#### 3. Add Cam View

- Top view (shows profile)
- Section view (shows thickness)

#### 4. Annotate Motion Zones

Add labels and angular dimensions:

```
0° - 120°: Rise (Lift = 20mm)
120° - 180°: Dwell (High)
180° - 300°: Return
300° - 360°: Dwell (Low)
```

#### 5. Add Follower Displacement Diagram

Create a separate diagram showing:
- X-axis: Cam rotation angle (0° to 360°)
- Y-axis: Follower displacement (0 to 20mm)
- Plot the motion profile

This can be a hand-drawn annotation or separate sketch.

#### 6. Export

- PDF export

---

## Part 9: Testing Parametric Control

### Change Lift

1. Open Spreadsheet
2. Change Lift from 20 to 30mm
3. Recompute
4. Cam profile updates (if designed parametrically with expressions)

### Change Base Circle Radius

- Try BaseCircleRadius = 50mm
- Larger cam

### Change Rise Angle

- Try RiseAngle = 90° (faster rise)
- Would require redrawing profile with new angle divisions

## Design Verification

<InArticleAd />


1. **Does the cam profile close (starts and ends at same point)?**
2. **Is the rise section smooth (no sharp corners)?**
3. **Do dwell sections maintain constant radius?**
4. **When cam rotates 360°, does follower complete full cycle?**
5. **Is the roller radius appropriate (not too large or small)?**

---

## Advanced: Calculating Cam Profile Mathematically

### Follower Displacement Function

For simple harmonic motion rise:

```
s(θ) = L × [1 - cos(π × θ / θ_rise)] / 2

Where:
s = displacement from base position
θ = cam angle
θ_rise = total rise angle (e.g., 120°)
L = total lift
```

### Cam Radius at Angle θ

```
R(θ) = R_b + s(θ) + R_roller

Where:
R_b = base circle radius
R_roller = roller radius (for roller follower)
```

Use these equations to calculate exact point positions for your cam profile.

## Challenges for Further Practice

1. **Design a cycloidal motion cam** (smoother acceleration than harmonic)
2. **Add a return spring** to keep follower in contact with cam
3. **Create a positive-drive cam** (groove cam, no spring needed)
4. **Design a conjugate cam** (two cams on same shaft for balanced forces)
5. **Model wear analysis** (contact stress zones)
6. **Create an adjustable lift mechanism** (eccentric mounting)

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Cam profile has sharp corners"

- **Cause:** Abrupt transitions between sections
- **Solution:** Use smooth curves (B-splines) or transition arcs
- **Fix:** Blend rise/dwell and return/dwell with tangent arcs

### "Follower jumps or vibrates"

- **Cause:** Excessive acceleration (sudden velocity change)
- **Solution:** Use smooth motion laws (harmonic, cycloidal)
- **Fix:** Avoid abrupt changes in cam profile slope

### "Roller doesn't maintain contact"

- **Cause:** Insufficient spring force (in real mechanism)
- **Solution:** Add return spring or use positive-drive cam
- **Fix:** In CAD, manually position for contact verification

### "Cannot create B-spline smoothly"

- **Solution:** Use multiple circular arcs as approximation
- **Tip:** 3-5 arcs can approximate harmonic motion acceptably
